Teadal cloud whirlwind tour
---------------------------
> Hang tight!

Let's check out the goodies we've installed.


### Setting the stage

You should have your Teadal cluster up and running somewhere and a
shell with a `KUBECONFIG` env var pointing to the admin creds for
your cluster.

The commands in the sections below assume you have

* cloned our repo
* started a Nix shell: `cd teadal.proto/nix && nix shell`

Also if your cluster is in the dev VM rather than a proper cloud,
well you should start the VM I guess? :-) E.g.

```bash
$ qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -machine q35,vmport=off -smp 4 -m 8G \
    -drive file=devm.img.raw,format=raw,if=virtio \
    -nic user,model=virtio-net-pci,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22,hostfwd=tcp::16443-:6443,hostfwd=tcp::80-:80,hostfwd=tcp::5432-:5432
```

Notice the port mappings in the above command. You might have to
tweak something like e.g. map port `8080` to `80` depending on what
perms you have on the host and whether some host services already
use those ports. All the examples below are based on the dev VM started
with those port mappings, e.g. `http://localhost/argocd`. Change
IP/hostname/ports in the examples below according to your setup.


### Argo CD

First off, browse to the Argo CD web app for a bird's eye view of
what the GitOps pipeline has deployed. Istio routes HTTP traffic
to port 80 and path `/argocd` to the Argo CD server inside the mesh.
So the web app is available at

- http://localhost/argocd/

Log in with the username and password you entered in the Argo CD K8s
secret. K8s resources are grouped into apps and, in turn, apps into
three projects (mesh-infra, plat-infra-services, plat-app-services)
to reflect the layout of the `deployment` dir in the Git repo.


### Istio

Istio got configured with a few useful add-ons, HTTP and TCP routing,
plus some settings to make it easier to intercept and debug raw network
packets. Any service deployed to the default namespace automatically
gets an Istio side car.

```bash
$ kubectl get pod
```

You should see Keycloak, Postgres and HttpBin entries, all having a
pod count of 2: one pod is the service proper, the other's the Istio
sidecar.

To see some mesh action, use `istioctl` to connect Kiali (one of the
installed add-ons) to your browser

```bash
$ istioctl d kiali
```

navigate to the HttpBin workload and then generate some traffic by
hitting the HttpBin SVG image endpoint many times in a row until
you see the Kiali graph

- http://localhost/httpbin/image/svg

(This works because the GitOps pipeline defined an HTTP route through
port `80` and path `/httpbin`.)
Have a look at the content of the other tabs in Kiali, especially
the traces to see Jaeger, another installed add-on, at work. Then
take a peek at the various performance dashboards

```bash
$ istioctl d grafana
```

Oh, truth be told, we also have SkyWalking. But that's not deployed
yet because we still have some bugs to squash.


### Storage

Three of the PVs should be bound. One for the Postgres DB, another
for Keycloak's DB and the last one for the Teadal MinIO tenant.

```bash
$ kubectl get pv
$ kubectl get pvc -A
```

Log into the MinIO console. Run

```bash
$ kubectl minio proxy
```

then browse to http://localhost:9090 and enter the JWT token printed
on the terminal. You should see the Teadal tenant the GitOps pipeline
created. Istio routes the tenant's S3 service through port `80` and
path `/minio`. So you should be able to hit the service from your box
like this

```bash
$ curl -v http://localhost/minio
```

You should get a fat `403` response. Access is denied without valid
creds. How rude.


### Security

Keycloak is at http://localhost/keycloak, courtesy of Istio routing.
Navigate to the admin console and log in with the username and password
you set in the Keycloak K8s secret.

Speaking of secrets, we've got Reloader to watch for secret changes
and bounce affected pods. So secrets always stay fresh. Have a look
at the K8s logs to see what's going on under the bonnet.

After logging onto Keycloak you should check there's a Teadal realm
with two users, `jeejee@teadal.eu` and `sebs@teadal.eu`, both having
log-in enabled and a password of `abc123`. The GitOps pipeline creates
and pre-populates the Teadal realm automatically.

Now you should check out how we secure data products. Our setup ain't
exactly straightforward, so to make sense of the examples below you
should probably first read about [our security architecture][sec],
at least the conceptual model section.

We'll use HttpBin to simulate a data product. There's a [policy][httpbin-rbac]
that defines two roles:
- *Product owner*. The owner may do any kind of HTTP request to URLs
   starting with `/httpbin/anything/`.
- *Product consumer*. On the other hand, the consumer is only allowed
  to read (`GET`) URLs starting with `/httpbin/anything/` or the (exact)
  URL `/httpbin/get`.

`jeejee@teadal.eu` is both a product owner and consumer, whereas
`sebs@teadal.eu` is just a consumer. There's also a third role,
`monitor`, which is only defined in Keycloak as a group in the
Teadal realm and `jeejee@teadal.eu` is the only group member. The
policy references this external role to grant access to the IP echo
endpoint at `/httpbin/ip`. Keycloak is configured to output a `roles`
field in the access token (see below) it issues for its users. This
field is an array containing all the groups the user is a member of.
So `roles: [monitor]` for `jeejee@teadal.eu` whereas `roles: []` for
`sebs@teadal.eu`.

To interact with HttpBin, both users need to get a JWT from Keycloak
and attach it to service requests since the policy doesn't allow
anonymous requests to the above URLs. In fact, if you try e.g.

```bash
$ curl -i -X GET localhost/httpbin/anything/do
$ curl -i -X GET localhost/httpbin/get
$ curl -i -X GET localhost/httpbin/ip
```

you should get back a fat `403` in each cases. So let's get a JWT
for `jeejee@teadal.eu`. We'll store it in a env var so we can use
it later. The command below should do the trick. (If you've changed
the user's password in Keycloak, replace `abc123` with the new one.)

```bash
$ export jeejees_token=$(\
    curl -s \
      http://localhost/keycloak/realms/teadal/protocol/openid-connect/token \
      -d 'grant_type=password' -d 'client_id=admin-cli' \
      -d 'username=jeejee@teadal.eu' -d 'password=abc123' | jq -r '.access_token')
```

And, as we're at it, let's get a JWT for `sebs@teadal.eu` too.

```bash
$ export sebs_token=$(\
    curl -s \
      http://localhost/keycloak/realms/teadal/protocol/openid-connect/token \
      -d 'grant_type=password' -d 'client_id=admin-cli' \
      -d 'username=sebs@teadal.eu' -d 'password=abc123' | jq -r '.access_token')
```

Again, if you've changed `sebs@teadal.eu`'s password, update the
command above accordingly. Also keep in mind these tokens are quite
short-lived (about 4 mins) so if you take too long to go through the
examples below, you'll have to get fresh tokens again.

Both product owner and consumer are allowed to read a URL path like
`/httpbin/anything/do`. So both users, `jeejee@teadal.eu` (owner)
and `sebs@teadal.eu` (consumer), should be able to do a GET and get
back (pun intended) a `200`, provided we attach their respective JWT
to the each request:

```bash
$ curl -i -X GET localhost/httpbin/anything/do \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${jeejees_token}"
$ curl -i -X GET localhost/httpbin/anything/do \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${sebs_token}"
```

But, as a product owner, `jeejee@teadal.eu` should be able to do
anything he fancies to the above path, like `DELETE`, whereas
`sebs@teadal.eu`, as a consumer, should not.

```bash
$ curl -i -X DELETE localhost/httpbin/anything/do \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${jeejees_token}"
$ curl -i -X DELETE localhost/httpbin/anything/do \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${sebs_token}"
```

You should see a `200` response for the first request, but a `403`
for the second. Also, since both users are product consumers, they
should both allowed to `GET /httpbin/get`

```bash
$ curl -i -X GET localhost/httpbin/get \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${jeejees_token}"
$ curl -i -X GET localhost/httpbin/get \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${sebs_token}"
```

You should see a `200` response in both cases. Now, members of the
`monitor` group should be allowed to `GET /httpbin/ip`. Since
`jeejee@teadal.eu` is a member and `sebs@teadal.eu` is not, the below
requests should return `200` and `403`, respectively.

```bash
$ curl -i -X GET localhost/httpbin/ip \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${jeejees_token}"
$ curl -i -X GET localhost/httpbin/ip \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${sebs_token}"
```

Finally, `sebs@teadal.eu`, but no one else, should be allowed to
`GET /httpbin/uuid`. In fact, this is the case as you can see from
the requests below which return `403` for `jeejee@teadal.eu` and
`200` for `sebs@teadal.eu`.

```bash
$ curl -i -X GET localhost/httpbin/ip \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${jeejees_token}"
$ curl -i -X GET localhost/httpbin/ip \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer ${sebs_token}"
```

That just about wraps it up for the security show.


### DBs

At the moment we only have Postgres. Istio routes incoming TCP traffic
from port `5432` to the Postgres server. Here's an easy way to get
into the DB with `psql` from your local machine.

```
$ nix-shell -p postgresql_15
$ psql postgres://postgres:abc123@localhost
```

Replace `abc123` with the password you entered in the Postgres K8s
secret.

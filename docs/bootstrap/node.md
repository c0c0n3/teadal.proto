Bootstrapping a cluster node
----------------------------
> The real thing...

**TODO**
- very similar to VM procedure
- need to write Nix exprs for K8s master and slave node---do when
  we have a multi-node cluster
- for now: follow the same procedure as for the dev box but make it
  secure---firewall, ssh, passwords, K8s certs, etc.
- if we ever need HA, check out: https://github.com/justinas/nixos-ha-kubernetes

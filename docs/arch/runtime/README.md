Teadal runtime architecture
---------------------------
> It's showtime!

We look at the Teadal runtime architecture from both an abstract
and more concrete standpoint:

- [Specification][spec]. What the Teadal cluster runtime should look
  like. Abstract description of the services that typically run in
  a Teadal cluster instance in terms of the functionality they provide
  without reference to actual software implementing that functionality.
- [Implementation][impl]. Complements the abstract description with
  the software products that have been selected implement the above
  spec and also details the actual deployment process.




[spec]: ./spec.md
[impl]: ./implementation.md

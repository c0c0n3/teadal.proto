How to establish trust in a Teadal federation? While federated data
products, the Catalogue, identity federation, and security policies
provide the means to securely and efficiently share data among Teadal
nodes according to agreed-upon terms, an additional layer of trust
is often necessary. Organisations involved in data sharing must have
confidence that data are stored, handled, and exchanged in compliance
with their specified terms. Trust, therefore, must extend beyond the
boundaries of a single Teadal node to encompass all federation nodes
involved in a data transaction.

The Teadal Trust Plane, a groundbreaking innovation, offers a solution
for establishing trust within a federation. This Trust Plane is an
evidence-based trust framework that enables all parties involved in
the data exchange process to review verifiable evidence ensuring
that the Teadal runtime executes data transactions as expected. By
utilising Advocate and privacy-preserving technologies, the Trust
Plane generates and collects verifiable evidence throughout the Teadal
infrastructure. Importantly, this evidence is linked back to the
individuals responsible for each data transaction. The collected
evidence is published on a decentralised, distributed storage system
(IPFS) and anchored to the Teadal blockchain for immutability and
transparency. This storage and blockchain infrastructure spans across
all the nodes in the federation.

Thus, the Trust Plane plays a pivotal role in establishing trust
in the system by ensuring that the observed behaviour of the system
aligns with predefined expectations.

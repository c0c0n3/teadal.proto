# Secure access to the cluster by delegating authz decisions to our
# OPA instance.
#
# Notice this rule applies to all traffic through port 80 of the Istio
# ingress gateway, except for some paths. We could be more specific if
# need be---e.g. have separate rules for different services, ports, etc.
# instead of this catch-all rule at the ingress gateway level.
